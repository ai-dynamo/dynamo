# Documentation Reorganization - Summary

**Branch**: `docs-reorg`
**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Changes Summary

### Files Changed: 30

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Consistent Naming** ✅
- Renamed `API/` → `api/` (lowercase consistency)
- Standardized guide names to kebab-case

### 2. **Logical Organization** ✅
Created 4 new logical sections:
- `observability/` - Monitoring, logging, health checks
- `performance/` - Performance tuning guides
- `development/` - Backend development, runtime guides
- `reference/` - CLI, glossary, support matrix

### 3. **Cleaned Up Scattered Content** ✅
- Distributed `guides/` (9 files) to appropriate sections
- Moved backend-specific guides to backends/
- Consolidated reference material
- Removed empty `deploy/` and `runtime/` directories

### 4. **Updated All Links** ✅
- Updated ~50+ internal links throughout documentation
- Updated main navigation (index.rst)
- Updated hidden page references (hidden_toctree.rst)
- All cross-references working
