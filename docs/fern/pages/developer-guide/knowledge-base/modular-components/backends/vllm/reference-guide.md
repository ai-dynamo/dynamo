subtitle: Configuration, arguments, and operational details for the vLLM backend
---

## Overview

The vLLM backend in Dynamo integrates [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) engines into Dynamo's distributed runtime, enabling disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request cancellation. Dynamo leverages vLLM's native KV cache events, NIXL-based transfer mechanisms, and metric reporting.

Dynamo vLLM uses vLLM's native argument parser — all vLLM engine arguments are passed through directly. Dynamo adds its own arguments for disaggregation mode, KV transfer, and prompt embeddings.

## Argument Reference

The vLLM backend accepts all upstream vLLM engine arguments plus Dynamo-specific arguments. The authoritative source is always the CLI:

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

The `--help` output is organized into the following groups:

- **Dynamo Runtime Options** — Namespace, discovery backend, request/event plane, endpoint types, tool/reasoning parsers, and custom chat templates. These are common across all Dynamo backends and use `DYN_*` env vars. See [Runtime Configuration](../../../../../reference/components/runtime-configuration.mdx) for the full field reference.
- **Dynamo vLLM Options** — Disaggregation mode, tokenizer selection, sleep mode, multimodal flags, vLLM-Omni pipeline configuration, headless mode, and ModelExpress. These use `DYN_VLLM_*` env vars. See [vLLM Configuration](../../../../../reference/backends/vllm-configuration.mdx) for the full field reference.
- **vLLM Engine Options** — All native vLLM arguments (`--model`, `--tensor-parallel-size`, `--kv-transfer-config`, `--kv-events-config`, `--enable-prefix-caching`, etc.). See the [vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Tool and Reasoning Parsers

Use `--dyn-tool-call-parser` and `--dyn-reasoning-parser` to match the model's output format when the model emits tool calls and/or reasoning content. The current supported values are documented in [Tool Call Parsing (Dynamo)](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/tool-call-parsing.mdx#supported-tool-call-parsers) and [Reasoning Parsing (Dynamo)](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/reasoning-parsing.md#supported-reasoning-parsers).

To set the thinking mode used when a request omits an explicit control, pass
`--dyn-default-thinking-mode enabled|disabled` or set
`DYN_DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE`. Request-level thinking controls, including
adaptive thinking, take precedence. See
[Deployment-Level Thinking Default](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/reasoning-parsing.md#deployment-level-thinking-default).

For reasoning models with structured output (`response_format`, JSON schema,
or required/named tool choice), configure both reasoning parsers on the worker:

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm --model <model> \
  --reasoning-parser <vllm-parser> \
  --dyn-reasoning-parser <dynamo-parser>
```

The vLLM parser delays grammar enforcement until reasoning ends; the Dynamo
parser populates `reasoning_content`. Parser names can differ between registries.

### Priority Scheduling

vLLM engine-level request priority is controlled by the upstream vLLM
`--scheduling-policy priority` argument.

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm \
    --model <model> \
    --scheduling-policy priority
```

Clients still send the Dynamo API value directly:
`nvext.agent_hints.priority`. Higher values mean higher priority at the Dynamo
API layer. Dynamo converts that value before passing it to vLLM, which uses a
different native priority polarity internally.

Do not negate `nvext.agent_hints.priority` in the client for vLLM. If you are
also using the router queue, configure the frontend-side
`--router-queue-threshold` separately; vLLM engine scheduling only applies
after a request reaches the worker.

For the cross-layer behavior, see
[Priority Scheduling](../../../../../use-cases/agents/priority-scheduling.md). For the upstream
flag definition, see the
[vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Prompt Embeddings

Dynamo supports [vLLM prompt embeddings](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/prompt_embeds.html) — pre-computed embeddings bypass tokenization in the Rust frontend and are decoded to tensors in the worker.

- Enable with `--enable-prompt-embeds` (disabled by default)
- Embeddings are sent as base64-encoded PyTorch tensors via the `prompt_embeds` field in the Completions API
- NATS must be configured with a 15MB max payload for large embeddings (already set in default deployments)

### Custom Modality Inputs

Models that register their own vLLM multimodal processor — a custom modality whose inputs are not images, video, or audio URLs — accept a JSON-safe payload through the `multi_modal_data` field on the Completions API.

The frontend does not interpret the payload. It admits the field, carries it to the worker in its own wire field (separate from the URL and RDMA media the frontend materializes itself), and the worker installs it as the engine's `multi_modal_data`. Your registered processor owns all validation of the values.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "<model>",
    "prompt": [1, 2, 3],
    "max_tokens": 16,
    "multi_modal_data": {
      "custom_input": {"dtype": "float32-le", "shape": [2, 4], "data_base64": "AAAAAA=="}
    }
  }'
```

- Enable with `--enable-multimodal`; the worker rejects the payload otherwise
- The payload must be a non-empty JSON object mapping a modality name to its value
- Values are forwarded as the same semantic JSON value; the frontend applies no modality-specific schema transformation
- Modality names are yours to choose, including names the frontend uses for its own media: a backend payload never reaches frontend media handling
- Cannot be combined with `prompt_embeds`, which replaces the entire prompt and leaves no placeholder sequence for the processor to expand
- Chat Completions uses content parts for media instead; this field is Completions-only
- The payload travels the request plane inline, so size it against your NATS `max_payload` as you would for `prompt_embeds`

> [!NOTE]
> KV-aware routing scores this request on its placeholder prompt tokens alone, because the frontend cannot hash a payload it does not interpret. Two requests with the same prompt and different payloads look identical to the router. The engine's own prefix cache is unaffected — vLLM folds multimodal identity into its block hashes — but router prefix-overlap estimates will be optimistic.

> [!NOTE]
> Disaggregated serving is supported for models whose decode leg continues from the prefill worker's expanded prompt token IDs. Qwen-VL rebuilds mRoPE position IDs from `image_grid_thw`, which Dynamo cannot derive from a payload it does not interpret, so it rejects the payload in disaggregated mode. Use aggregated serving for that family.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the vLLM backend installs this payload. The SGLang and TensorRT-LLM backends reject the request rather than answer it as if it were text-only.

## Hashing Consistency for KV Events

When using KV-aware routing, ensure deterministic hashing across processes to avoid radix tree mismatches. Choose one of the following:

- Set `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` for all vLLM processes when relying on Python's built-in hashing for prefix caching.
- If your vLLM version supports it, configure a deterministic prefix caching algorithm:

```bash
vllm serve ... --enable-prefix-caching --prefix-caching-algo sha256
```

See the high-level notes in [Router Design](../../router/router-design.md#deterministic-event-ids) on deterministic event IDs.

## Graceful Shutdown

vLLM workers use Dynamo's graceful shutdown mechanism. When a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` is received:

1. **Discovery unregister**: The worker is removed from service discovery so no new requests are routed to it
2. **Grace period**: In-flight requests are allowed to complete (configurable via `DYN_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECS`, default 5s)
3. **Resource cleanup**: Engine resources and temporary files (Prometheus dirs, LoRA adapters) are released

All vLLM endpoints use `graceful_shutdown=True`, meaning they wait for in-flight requests to finish before exiting. An internal `VllmEngineMonitor` also checks engine health every 2 seconds and initiates shutdown if the engine becomes unresponsive.

For more details, see [Graceful Shutdown](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/graceful-shutdown.md).

## Health Checks

Each worker type has a specialized health check payload that validates the full inference pipeline:

| Worker Type | Health Check Strategy |
|------------|----------------------|
| Decode / Aggregated | Short generation request (`max_tokens=1`) using the model's BOS token |
| Prefill | Same payload structure as decode, adapted for prefill request format |
| vLLM-Omni | Short generation request via AsyncOmni with the model's BOS token |

Health checks are registered with the Dynamo runtime and called by the frontend or Kubernetes liveness probes. The payload can be overridden via `DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_PAYLOAD` environment variable. See [Observability Architecture](../../../concepts/observability-architecture.md#active-worker-health-checks) for the active health-check design.

## Request Cancellation

When a user cancels a request (e.g., by disconnecting from the frontend), the request is automatically cancelled across all workers, freeing compute resources.

| | Prefill | Decode |
|-|---------|--------|
| **Aggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Disaggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |

For more details, see the [Request Cancellation Architecture](../../../concepts/fault-tolerance/request-cancellation-architecture.md) documentation.

## Request Migration

Dynamo supports [request migration](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) to handle worker failures gracefully. When enabled, requests can be automatically migrated to healthy workers if a worker fails mid-generation. See the [Request Migration Architecture](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) documentation for configuration details.
