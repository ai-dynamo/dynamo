subtitle: Configuration, arguments, and operational details for the vLLM backend
---

## Overview

The vLLM backend in Dynamo integrates [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) engines into Dynamo's distributed runtime, enabling disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, and request cancellation. Dynamo leverages vLLM's native KV cache events, NIXL-based transfer mechanisms, and metric reporting.

Dynamo vLLM uses vLLM's native argument parser — all vLLM engine arguments are passed through directly. Dynamo adds its own arguments for disaggregation mode, KV transfer, and prompt embeddings.

## Argument Reference

The vLLM backend accepts all upstream vLLM engine arguments plus Dynamo-specific arguments. The authoritative source is always the CLI:

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm --help
```

The `--help` output is organized into the following groups:

- **Dynamo Runtime Options** — Namespace, discovery backend, request/event plane, endpoint types, tool/reasoning parsers, and custom chat templates. These are common across all Dynamo backends and use `DYN_*` env vars. See [Runtime Configuration](../../../../../reference/components/runtime-configuration.mdx) for the full field reference.
- **Dynamo vLLM Options** — Disaggregation mode, tokenizer selection, sleep mode, multimodal flags, vLLM-Omni pipeline configuration, headless mode, and ModelExpress. These use `DYN_VLLM_*` env vars. See [vLLM Configuration](../../../../../reference/backends/vllm-configuration.mdx) for the full field reference.
- **vLLM Engine Options** — All native vLLM arguments (`--model`, `--tensor-parallel-size`, `--kv-transfer-config`, `--kv-events-config`, `--enable-prefix-caching`, etc.). See the [vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Tool and Reasoning Parsers

Use `--dyn-tool-call-parser` and `--dyn-reasoning-parser` to match the model's output format when the model emits tool calls and/or reasoning content. The current supported values are documented in [Tool Call Parsing (Dynamo)](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/tool-call-parsing.mdx#supported-tool-call-parsers) and [Reasoning Parsing (Dynamo)](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/reasoning-parsing.md#supported-reasoning-parsers).

To set the thinking mode used when a request omits an explicit control, pass
`--dyn-default-thinking-mode enabled|disabled` or set
`DYN_DEFAULT_THINKING_MODE`. Request-level thinking controls, including
adaptive thinking, take precedence. See
[Deployment-Level Thinking Default](../../../../../use-cases/tool-calling-and-reasoning/reasoning-parsing.md#deployment-level-thinking-default).

For reasoning models with structured output (`response_format`, JSON schema,
or required/named tool choice), configure both reasoning parsers on the worker:

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm --model <model> \
  --reasoning-parser <vllm-parser> \
  --dyn-reasoning-parser <dynamo-parser>
```

The vLLM parser delays grammar enforcement until reasoning ends; the Dynamo
parser populates `reasoning_content`. Parser names can differ between registries.

### Priority Scheduling

vLLM engine-level request priority is controlled by the upstream vLLM
`--scheduling-policy priority` argument.

```bash
python -m dynamo.vllm \
    --model <model> \
    --scheduling-policy priority
```

Clients still send the Dynamo API value directly:
`nvext.agent_hints.priority`. Higher values mean higher priority at the Dynamo
API layer. Dynamo converts that value before passing it to vLLM, which uses a
different native priority polarity internally.

Do not negate `nvext.agent_hints.priority` in the client for vLLM. If you are
also using the router queue, configure the frontend-side
`--router-queue-threshold` separately; vLLM engine scheduling only applies
after a request reaches the worker.

For the cross-layer behavior, see
[Priority Scheduling](../../../../../use-cases/agents/priority-scheduling.md). For the upstream
flag definition, see the
[vLLM serve args documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/configuration/serve_args.html).

### Prompt Embeddings

Dynamo supports [vLLM prompt embeddings](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/prompt_embeds.html) — pre-computed embeddings bypass tokenization in the Rust frontend and are decoded to tensors in the worker.

- Enable with `--enable-prompt-embeds` (disabled by default)
- Embeddings are sent as base64-encoded PyTorch tensors via the `prompt_embeds` field in the Completions API
- NATS must be configured with a 15MB max payload for large embeddings (already set in default deployments)

### Custom JSON Content

**Experimental, unreleased.** Aggregated Python vLLM token workers started with
`--enable-multimodal` accept explicit custom parts in user and tool messages:

The example combines projected chemistry soft tokens with a standard image URL.
The model must support both the registered chemistry modality and image inputs.
The payload names and encoding inside `fields` are application-defined:

```json
{
  "model": "chemistry-vision-model",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {"type": "text", "text": "Does this structure <chemistry> match the reaction diagram?"},
      {"type": "custom", "kind": "chemistry", "fields": {
        "projected_soft_tokens": {
          "dtype": "float32", "shape": [2, 4096], "data_base64": "..."
        },
        "revision": 1
      }},
      {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.org/reaction-diagram.png"}}
    ]
  }],
  "max_tokens": 64
}
```

The model name, tensor dimensions, encoded bytes, and image URL are illustrative.
`kind` is a non-empty string. The built-in wire names `text`, `image_url`,
`video_url`, `audio_url`, and `input_audio` are reserved and rejected as custom
kinds, including when mixed with typed media. `fields` is a JSON object whose
values may be any JSON, including arrays and null. Dynamo passes the **complete
fields object** as `multi_modal_data[kind]`; the example processor receives both
`projected_soft_tokens` and `revision` under the chemistry modality. Dynamo does
**not** select `fields[kind]` or decode the base64 bytes. Repeated parts of one
kind become an ordered list of fields objects. Built-in image, video and audio
parts retain their existing typed schema and validation. They may share requests
with custom parts when their engine modality names do not collide.

The model plugin owns domain validation and interpretation. Install or mount it
in the worker environment. Dynamo excludes custom parts before serializing chat
templates and auxiliary messages, keeping the payload in `multi_modal_data` only.
Put processor placeholders such as `<chemistry>` in text parts. For a pre-rendered
prompt, set `nvext.use_raw_prompt: true` and provide exactly one user message;
Dynamo concatenates its text parts without another chat template. For token IDs,
use `nvext.token_data`. Engine token IDs/logprobs remain available through
`nvext.engine_data` independently of parser-rewritten choice text.

Custom fields remain opaque JSON, including any base64 strings, shape/dtype
metadata, or plugin-defined reference objects. The model plugin owns their
validation and decoding. Dynamo does not define an inline tensor format or
resolve arbitrary tensor references from this HTTP envelope.

Existing image/audio/video transfers keep their maintained SHM/NIXL paths.
Processed vLLM `mm_kwargs` and embedding transfer descriptors are internal
handoffs, not public HTTP inputs for arbitrary custom tensors. Their serialization,
staging, copying, and buffer ownership remain unchanged; no zero-copy GPU claim
is made for custom JSON.

Selected workers must advertise `custom_json_v1`. Custom P/D, encoder
disaggregation, speculative prefill, custom caching/KVBM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM,
and native vLLM sidecars are unsupported. Extending these paths requires a
separate qualification of plugin payload identity and lifecycle.

## Hashing Consistency for KV Events

When using KV-aware routing, ensure deterministic hashing across processes to avoid radix tree mismatches. Choose one of the following:

- Set `PYTHONHASHSEED=0` for all vLLM processes when relying on Python's built-in hashing for prefix caching.
- If your vLLM version supports it, configure a deterministic prefix caching algorithm:

```bash
vllm serve ... --enable-prefix-caching --prefix-caching-algo sha256
```

See the high-level notes in [Router Design](../../router/router-design.md#deterministic-event-ids) on deterministic event IDs.

## Graceful Shutdown

vLLM workers use Dynamo's graceful shutdown mechanism. When a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` is received:

1. **Discovery unregister**: The worker is removed from service discovery so no new requests are routed to it
2. **Grace period**: In-flight requests are allowed to complete (configurable via `DYN_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD_SECS`, default 5s)
3. **Resource cleanup**: Engine resources and temporary files (Prometheus dirs, LoRA adapters) are released

All vLLM endpoints use `graceful_shutdown=True`, meaning they wait for in-flight requests to finish before exiting. An internal `VllmEngineMonitor` also checks engine health every 2 seconds and initiates shutdown if the engine becomes unresponsive.

For more details, see [Graceful Shutdown](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/graceful-shutdown.md).

## Health Checks

Each worker type has a specialized health check payload that validates the full inference pipeline:

| Worker Type | Health Check Strategy |
|------------|----------------------|
| Decode / Aggregated | Short generation request (`max_tokens=1`) using the model's BOS token |
| Prefill | Same payload structure as decode, adapted for prefill request format |
| vLLM-Omni | Short generation request via AsyncOmni with the model's BOS token |

Health checks are registered with the Dynamo runtime and called by the frontend or Kubernetes liveness probes. The payload can be overridden via `DYN_HEALTH_CHECK_PAYLOAD` environment variable. See [Observability Architecture](../../../concepts/observability-architecture.md#active-worker-health-checks) for the active health-check design.

## Request Cancellation

When a user cancels a request (e.g., by disconnecting from the frontend), the request is automatically cancelled across all workers, freeing compute resources.

| | Prefill | Decode |
|-|---------|--------|
| **Aggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Disaggregated** | ✅ | ✅ |

For more details, see the [Request Cancellation Architecture](../../../concepts/fault-tolerance/request-cancellation-architecture.md) documentation.

## Request Migration

Dynamo supports [request migration](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) to handle worker failures gracefully. When enabled, requests can be automatically migrated to healthy workers if a worker fails mid-generation. See the [Request Migration Architecture](../../../../../kubernetes/fault-tolerance/request-migration.md) documentation for configuration details.
