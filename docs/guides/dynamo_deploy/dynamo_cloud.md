# üöÄ Dynamo Cloud Kubernetes Platform (Dynamo Deploy)

The Dynamo Cloud platform is a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing Dynamo inference graphs (also referred to as pipelines) in Kubernetes environments. It provides a streamlined experience for deploying, scaling, and monitoring your inference services. You can interface with Dynamo Cloud using the `deploy` subcommand available in the Dynamo CLI (e.g `dynamo deploy`)

## Overview

The Dynamo cloud platform consists of several key components:

- **Dynamo Operator**: A Kubernetes operator that manages the lifecycle of Dynamo inference graphs from build ‚û°Ô∏è deploy.
- **API Store**: Stores and manages service configurations and metadata related to Dynamo deployments. Needs to be exposed externally.
- **Custom Resources**: Kubernetes custom resources for defining and managing Dynamo services

These components work together to provide a seamless deployment experience, handling everything from containerization to scaling and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the Dynamo cloud platform, ensure you have:

- A Kubernetes cluster (version 1.24 or later)
- [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) installed for building components
- Docker installed and running
- Access to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, NVIDIA NGC, etc.)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- Helm installed (version 3.0 or later)

## Building Docker Images for Dynamo Cloud Components

The Dynamo cloud platform components need to be built and pushed to a container registry before deployment. You can build these components individually or all at once.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

First, set the required environment variables for building and pushing images:

```bash
# Set your container registry and organization
export CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=<CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<ORGANIZATION>
# Set the image tag (e.g., latest, 0.0.1, etc.)
export CI_COMMIT_SHA=<TAG>
```

Where:
- `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<ORGANIZATION>`: Your container registry and organization name
  - Examples: `nvcr.io/myorg`, `docker.io/myorg`
- `<TAG>`: The version tag for your images
  - Examples: `latest`, `0.0.1`, `v1.0.0`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you're logged in to your container registry before pushing images:
> ```bash
> docker login <CONTAINER_REGISTRY>
> ```

### Building Components

You have two options for building the components:

#### Option 1: Build All Components at Once

This is the simplest approach and builds and pushes all components in a single command:

```bash
earthly --push +all-docker --CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE --CI_COMMIT_SHA=$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

#### Option 2: Build Components Individually

If you need to build components separately:

1. **API Store**
```bash
cd deploy/dynamo/api-store
earthly --push +docker --CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE --CI_COMMIT_SHA=$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

2. **Operator**
```bash
cd deploy/dynamo/operator
earthly --push +docker --CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE --CI_COMMIT_SHA=$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

## Deploying the Dynamo Cloud Platform

Once you've built and pushed the components, you can deploy the platform to your Kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```bash
cd deploy/dynamo/helm
```

Set your namespace (this will be used for all deployments):
```bash
export KUBE_NS=hello-world    # Change this to your preferred namespace
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Create Namespace and Set Context**

```bash
# Create a new namespace
kubectl create namespace $KUBE_NS

# Set the namespace as your default context
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=$KUBE_NS

# [Optional] Create image pull secrets if your registry requires authentication
kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-imagepullsecret \
  --docker-server=<your-registry> \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --namespace=$KUBE_NS
```

2. **Deploy Using the Helm Chart**

Set the required environment variables:
```bash
export NGC_TOKEN=$NGC_API_TOKEN
export NAMESPACE=$KUBE_NS
export CI_COMMIT_SHA=<TAG>  # Use the same tag you used when building the images
export CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE=<CONTAINER_REGISTRY>/<ORGANIZATION>  # Use the same registry/org you used when building the images
export RELEASE_NAME=$KUBE_NS
```

Deploy the platform:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

3. **Expose Dynamo Cloud Externally**

You must also expose the `dynamo-store` service within the namespace externally. This will be the endpoint the CLI uses to interface with Dynamo Cloud. You might setup an Ingress, use an `ExternalService` with Istio, or simply port-forward. In our docs, we refer to this externally available endpoint as `DYNAMO_CLOUD`.

## Next Steps

After deploying the Dynamo cloud platform, you can:

1. Deploy your first inference graph using the [Dynamo CLI](operator_deployment.md)
2. Deploy Dynamo LLM pipelines to Kubernetes using the [Dynamo CLI](../../../examples/llm/README.md)!
3. Manage your deployments using the Dynamo CLI

For more detailed information about deploying inference graphs, see the [Dynamo Deploy Guide](README.md).
