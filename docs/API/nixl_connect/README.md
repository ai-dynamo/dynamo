# Dynamo NIXL Connect

Dynamo connect provides utilities for using the NIXL base RDMA subsystem via a set of Python classes.
The primary goal of this library to simplify the integration of NIXL based RDMA into inference applications.
The `dynamo.nixl_connect` library can be imported by any Dynamo container hosted application.

```python
import dynamo.nixl_connect
```

All operations using the NIXL Connect library begin with the [`Connector`](connector.md) class and the type of operation required.
There are four types of supported operations:

 1. **Register local readable memory**:

    Register local memory buffer(s) with the RDMA subsystem to enable a remote worker to read from.

 2. **Register local writable memory**:

    Register local memory buffer(s) with the RDMA subsystem to enable a remote worker to write to.

 3. **Read from registered, remote memory**:

    Read remote memory buffer(s), registered by a remote worker to be readable, into local memory buffer(s).

 4. **Write to registered, remote memory**:

    Write local memory buffer(s) to remote memory buffer(s) registered by a remote worker to writable.

By connecting correctly paired operations, high-throughput GPU Direct RDMA data transfers can be completed.
Given the list above, the correct pairing of operations would be 1 & 3 or 2 & 4.
Where one side is a "(read|write)-able operation" and the other is its correctly paired "(read|write) operation".
Specifically, a read operation must be paired with a readable operation, and a write operation must be paired with a writable operation.

    LocalWorker ->> NIXL: Register memory (Descriptor)
    RemoteWorker ->> NIXL: Register memory (Descriptor)
    LocalWorker ->> LocalWorker: Create Readable/WritableOperation
    LocalWorker ->> RemoteWorker: Send RDMA metadata (via HTTP/TCP+NATS)
    RemoteWorker ->> NIXL: Begin Read/WriteOperation with metadata
    NIXL -->> RemoteWorker: Data transfer (RDMA)
    RemoteWorker -->> LocalWorker: Notify completion (unblock awaiter)
```
