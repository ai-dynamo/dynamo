            DGDScalingAdapter provides a scaling interface for individual services
            within a DynamoGraphDeployment. It implements the Kubernetes scale
            subresource, enabling integration with HPA, KEDA, and custom autoscalers.

            The adapter acts as an intermediary between autoscalers and the DGD,
            ensuring that only the adapter controller modifies the DGD's service replicas.
            This prevents conflicts when multiple autoscaling mechanisms are in play.
