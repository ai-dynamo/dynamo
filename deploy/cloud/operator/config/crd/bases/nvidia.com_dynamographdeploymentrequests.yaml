            DynamoGraphDeploymentRequest is the Schema for the dynamographdeploymentrequests API.
            It serves as the primary interface for users to request model deployments with
            specific performance and resource constraints, enabling SLA-driven deployments.

            Lifecycle:
             1. Initial → Pending: Validates spec and prepares for profiling
             2. Pending → Profiling: Creates and runs profiling job (online or AIC)
             3. Profiling → Ready/Deploying: Generates DGD spec after profiling completes
             4. Deploying → Ready: When autoApply=true, monitors DGD until Ready
             5. Ready: Terminal state when DGD is operational or spec is available
             6. DeploymentDeleted: Terminal state when auto-created DGD is manually deleted

            The spec becomes immutable once profiling starts. Users must delete and recreate
            the DGDR to modify configuration after this point.

                    GeneratedDeployment contains the full generated DynamoGraphDeployment specification
                    including metadata, based on profiling results. Users can extract this to create
                    a DGD manually, or it's used automatically when autoApply is true.
                    Stored as RawExtension to preserve all fields including metadata.
