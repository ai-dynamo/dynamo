# üöÄ Deploy Dynamo Cloud to Kubernetes

Dynamo Cloud acts as an orchestration layer between the end user and Kubernetes, handling the complexity of deploying your graphs for you.
Before you can deploy your graphs you need to one-time deploy the dynamo runtime and dynamo cloud images.


## üèóÔ∏è Building Docker images for Dynamo Cloud components

You can build and push Docker images for the Dynamo cloud components (API server, API store, and operator) to any container registry of your choice. Here's how to build each component:

### üìã Prerequisites
- [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/) installed
- Docker installed and running
- Access to a container registry of your choice

#### üèóÔ∏è Build Dynamo inference runtime.

Make sure you have first built and pushed to your registry Dynamo Base Image for Dynamo inference runtime.

```bash
./container/build.sh
export IMAGE_TAG=<TAG>
# the above builds the dynamo:latest-vllm image.
docker tag dynamo:latest-vllm <your-registry>/dynamo:${IMAGE_TAG}
docker push <your-registry>/dynamo:${IMAGE_TAG}
```


#### üõ†Ô∏è Build and push Dynamo Cloud platform components

First, set the required environment variables:

```bash
export DOCKER_SERVER=<CONTAINER_REGISTRY>
export IMAGE_TAG=<TAG>
```

As a description of the placeholders:
- `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY>`: Your container registry (e.g., `nvcr.io`, `docker.io/<your-username>`, etc.)
- `<TAG>`: The tag you want to use for the images of the Dynamo cloud components (e.g., `latest`, `0.0.1`, etc.)
By default if you use the `dynamo deploy` cli, this tag has to match the tag of the runtime container image.
If the runtime image tag is not explicitly set, the default is the `dynamo:latest`.
If you are a dynamo user, your pick whatever dynamo version you want and deploy the Dynamo Cloud once for all of your future graphs.

If you are a contributor, you would need to rebuild these images if you make changes to the Operator or Api Store.
The tag will go into the dynamo-operator:<IMAGE_TAG> image for the Operator and api-store:<IMAGE_TAG> for the API Store.  The runtime (base) image handles the inference toolchain and the sdk and built by the (`build.sh`). Use the same tags for both images if deploying with `dynamo deploy`. The tags do not have to match if you specify tags explicitly in your Helm and/or dynamo deploy config. (but the images must be compatible)


Note: Make sure you're logged in to your container registry before pushing images. For example:
```bash
docker login <CONTAINER_REGISTRY>
```

You can build each component individually or build all components at once:


```bash
earthly --push +all-docker --DOCKER_SERVER=$DOCKER_SERVER --IMAGE_TAG=$IMAGE_TAG
```

## üöÄ Deploy Dynamo Cloud Platform

### üìã Prerequisites
Before deploying Dynamo Cloud, ensure your Kubernetes cluster meets the following requirements:

#### 1. üõ°Ô∏è Istio Installation
Dynamo Cloud requires Istio for service mesh capabilities. Verify Istio is installed and running:

```bash
# Check if Istio is installed
kubectl get pods -n istio-system

# Expected output should show running Istio pods
# istiod-* pods should be in Running state
```

#### 2. üíæ PVC Support with Default Storage Class
Dynamo Cloud requires Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) support with a default storage class. Verify your cluster configuration:

```bash
# Check if default storage class exists
kubectl get storageclass

# Expected output should show at least one storage class marked as (default)
# Example:
# NAME                 PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
# standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd    Delete          Immediate              true                   1d
```

> [!TIP]
> Don't have a Kubernetes cluster? Check out our [Minikube setup guide](../../../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/minikube.md) to set up a local environment! üè†

### üì• Installation

1. Set the required environment variables:
```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)
export DOCKER_USERNAME=<your-docker-username>
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your-docker-password>
export DOCKER_SERVER=<your-docker-server>
export IMAGE_TAG=<TAG>  # Use the same tag you used when building the images
export NAMESPACE=dynamo-cloud    # change this to whatever you want!
export DYNAMO_INGRESS_SUFFIX=dynamo-cloud.com # change this to whatever you want!
```

2. [One-time Action] Create a new kubernetes namespace and set it as your default. Create image pull secrets if needed.

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT/deploy/cloud/helm
kubectl create namespace $NAMESPACE
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=$NAMESPACE

kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-imagepullsecret \
  --docker-server=$DOCKER_SERVER \
  --docker-username=$DOCKER_USERNAME \
  --docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD \
  --namespace=$NAMESPACE
```

3. Deploy Dynamo Cloud using the Helm chart via the provided deploy script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```
