# Dynamo EPP Configuration for Gateway API Inference Extension v1.2.1
#
# This configuration sets up the EPP to use Dynamo's KV-aware router for
# intelligent worker selection based on KV cache overlap.
#
# The KV scorer sets routing headers that the Lua filter at the gateway
# reads to inject nvext into the request body:
#   - x-worker-instance-id: Selected worker ID
#   - x-prefiller-host-port: Prefill worker (disaggregated mode)
#   - x-dynamo-routing-mode: "aggregated" or "disaggregated"
#
apiVersion: inference.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
