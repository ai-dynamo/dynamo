# Global Frontend

An HTTP entry point that forwards requests to explicitly configured Dynamo pool
frontends. It reads only each request's `model` and passes the request and the
pool's response through as they are; the pool frontend owns validation,
preprocessing, generation, and the response format. Pool identity types live
in `dynamo-global-common`, and pool selection in `dynamo-global-router`.

```bash
cargo run -p dynamo-global-frontend -- --port 8000 \
  --pool ohio/dynamo/blue=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@http://127.0.0.1:8001 \
  --pool oregon/dynamo/green=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@http://127.0.0.1:8002
```

Each `--pool` uses `<cluster>/<namespace>/<DGD name>=<model>@<frontend URL>`,
where the cluster is the ID the pool's PoolRelay runs with (`--cluster-id`).
Repeat the flag for different pools. Comma-separated URLs after `@` configure
multiple frontends for the same pool. Pool identities are derived from the
cluster, namespace, and DGD name; duplicate identities are rejected. Until pools
come from Global Discovery, the cluster also names the pool's region.

Every `POST /v1/...` request (chat completions, completions, Responses,
embeddings, Anthropic messages, and so on) goes to the same route on the
selected pool's frontend, with the client's headers except hop-by-hop ones,
including `x-dynamo-session-id`, `x-request-id`, and `authorization`. The pool's
status, headers, and body come back unchanged, streamed or not, including its
error responses and SSE keep-alives. A request whose model no pool serves gets
404. A request whose pool frontend cannot be reached (connection refused or
timed out, or a failed name lookup) goes to one other pool; it gets 503 if that
fails too, or if the pool may already have the request, so it is never run
twice. `/v1/models` lists the
configured models, `/health` is healthy while some pool has a frontend, and
`/live` always answers.

## Pool selection

`--router-policy` chooses how each request picks a pool among those serving its
model; every policy then rotates across the pool's frontends.

| Policy | Picks |
|---|---|
| `round-robin` (default) | Each pool in turn. |
| `least-in-flight` | The pool with the fewest of this process's requests in flight. |
| `affinity` | The session's pool, nearest region first, moving only for a pool with much more room. |

`affinity` keeps each session's turns on one pool, so the pool's KV cache for
the session is reused. It compares pools by how full they are against their own
capacity: the fuller of their request slots (requests in flight over the
requests their workers can run at once) and their KV blocks. So pools of any
speed or size compare. A request goes to its session's pool, or, for a new
session or a request without a session ID, to the least full pool in the
nearest region. It goes elsewhere only when another pool has more than
`--headroom-factor` (default 2) times that pool's spare capacity, choosing the
nearest such pool, or when that pool is full, choosing the nearest pool with any
room. The session's pin moves with it. Pins are per process and expire after
`--session-idle-secs` (default 1800) without a request.

`affinity` needs `--region`, this process's region named as `--pool` names
clusters. It reads each pool's load from the pool's PoolRelay, given per pool
over plain HTTP. Each pool needs a Relay of its own, since a Relay reports the
load of everything it watches as one:

```bash
cargo run -p dynamo-global-frontend -- --port 8000 \
  --router-policy affinity --region ohio \
  --pool ohio/dynamo/blue=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@http://127.0.0.1:8001 \
  --pool oregon/dynamo/green=Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@http://127.0.0.1:8002 \
  --pool-relay ohio/dynamo/blue=http://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --pool-relay oregon/dynamo/green=http://127.0.0.1:50052
```

A report counts for three of its Relay's report windows, so a reconnect or a
briefly incomplete view does not lose a pool's load. A pool without a Relay, or
whose last report has aged out, counts as full: its sessions move to the
nearest pool with room, if any, and new requests try it after the pools whose
load is known. The round trip to each region is the median TCP connect time to
its pools, measured every 30 seconds; the request's own region counts as
zero.

## Metrics

`/metrics`, on the same port, serves the Global Frontend's Prometheus metrics,
named `dynamo_global_frontend_*`: requests per pool by response status,
`no_response` when the pool sends no response, or `cancelled` when the client
leaves before the pool's response headers arrive; requests answered without a
pool; time to first byte and duration per pool; and requests in flight per
pool. The `pool` label is the pool's
`<cluster>/<namespace>/<DGD name>` and `region` its region. On requests, `local`
says whether the pool is in `--region` (`unknown` without it), which gives the
share of requests kept in the region. Nothing is labelled from the request
body. Inter-token latency and token counts need the stream parsed, so they come
from the pool frontends' own metrics. See the
[Metrics Catalog](../../docs/fern/pages/reference/observability/metrics-catalog.mdx#global-frontend-metrics)
for each family.

## Deployment notes

- The Global Frontend holds a request's body, as received, only until it is
  written to the pool, not while the pool queues it. The body limit is
  `DYN_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT_MB` (default 45), as for Dynamo's HTTP service.
- A client that disconnects closes its connection to the pool, which cancels
  the request there.
- Requests to other regions go over long-lived connections that sit idle
  between bursts. Set `net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0` on the Global
  Frontend's hosts, or each idle connection starts over with a small send
  window and a long prompt costs extra round trips.

## Limitations

Pools are given on the command line; there is no discovery client, polling, or
registration. A request whose pool may already have it is not retried. The
listener has no TLS.

## Tests

Run CPU-only tests with:

```bash
cargo test -p dynamo-global-common -p dynamo-global-router -p dynamo-global-frontend
```

The common `PoolId` identifies a DGD using its deployment coordinates. It is
distinct from `dynamo_kv_router::identity::PoolId`, which identifies an indexer
domain/DC lane; Global View integration will need an explicit mapping.
