# lib/kv-router/src/scheduling

Scheduling decides whether a request can run now, which worker should receive it, and how its load is recorded while it runs.

## Queue hierarchy

There is one `SchedulerQueueActor` per scheduler. It owns one outer `PolicyQueue`, which owns one `PolicyClassQueue` for every class in the resolved profile.

    participant H as SchedulerQueue
    participant A as SchedulerQueueActor
    box PolicyQueue owns all class queues
        participant P as PolicyQueue
        participant C as PolicyClassQueue instances
    end
    participant S as WorkerSelector

    H->>A: Enqueue(request)
    A->>A: Resolve class_index
    alt Immediate path
        A->>S: select_worker(request)
        S-->>A: Selected worker
        A->>A: Reserve worker capacity and respond
    else Queued path
        A->>P: enqueue(class_index, request)
        P->>C: Push into the selected class queue
        H->>A: Update after capacity changes
        A->>P: pop_next()
        P->>C: Get one candidate per dispatchable class
        C-->>P: Dispatch candidate
        P-->>A: DRR winner
        A->>S: select_worker(request)
        S-->>A: Selected worker
        A->>A: Reserve worker capacity and respond
    end
```

- `SchedulerQueue` is the public handle that sends commands to the actor.
- `SchedulerQueueActor` classifies each request and chooses the immediate or queued path.
- `PolicyQueue` does not classify requests. It owns all class queues and uses deficit round robin (DRR) to give each class weighted turns.
- Each `PolicyClassQueue` owns ordering and accounting for one class such as `latency`, `agents`, or `batch`.
- `SchedulerQueueActor::admit_one` performs final worker selection and reserves worker capacity after either path.
- A single-class profile still uses `PolicyQueue`, but DRR has no cross-class effect.

## Per-class ready storage

`PolicyQueueEntry<T>` is one queued payload plus its class index, priority key, enqueue sequence, and token/accounting snapshot. In production, `T` is `QueuedRequest`, which wraps the `SchedulingRequest`, enqueue timestamp, and optional block hashes.

```text
PolicyClassQueue("agents")
├── pending: BinaryHeap<PolicyQueueEntry>                 # WorkerPlacement::Any
├── ready_by_worker: FxHashMap<WorkerWithDpRank, BinaryHeap<PolicyQueueEntry>>
│   ├── Worker(7, dp_rank=0) → heap of requests pinned to that rank
│   └── Worker(9, dp_rank=1) → heap of requests pinned to that rank
├── blocked_workers: FxHashSet<WorkerWithDpRank>
└── candidate_worker_heads: BTreeSet<WorkerLaneHead>       # one head per unblocked lane
```

- `pending` is the shared ready heap for requests where the existing selector may choose any eligible worker.
- `ready_by_worker` contains requests pinned to a particular worker and data-parallel rank. Each worker/rank heap is removed when its last request leaves.
- `candidate_worker_heads` tracks the highest-priority request for each worker. A worker is removed from this index while it is full, then checked again when capacity changes.
- A `PolicyClassQueue` does not own worker configuration, capacity, or scoring state. `WorkerWithDpRank` only identifies a queue pinned to one worker/rank; the actor and selector retain worker knowledge.
- Every heap uses the class's configured priority ordering. `BinaryHeap::peek()` reads its highest-priority root in O(1); push and pop are O(log n).
- `PolicyClassQueue::next_dispatchable` compares the shared root with the highest indexed worker head. It removes blocked worker heads until it finds a dispatchable one, so each blocked lane is checked once per capacity update rather than once per pop.
- `round_cursor` marks which class receives the next weighted turn. `carry_class` lets a class spend its unused share before that turn, but only if `next_dispatchable` confirms that its next request can run.
- A full Worker 7 can block only Worker 7's first request. It cannot hide a ready request for Worker 9 or one that can run on any worker.

## Guardrails

- A request ID identifies at most one active scheduler booking. Duplicate adds
  conflict regardless of the target worker. A serialized migration retry may
  reuse the ID only after the previous booking has been released.
- Before an unpinned retry, exclude every worker already failed by that migration state machine. Preserve caller allowlists and routing constraints. An affinity-derived pin may be invalidated and rebound; an explicit request pin remains exact.
- A failed stream releases its scheduler booking before the error reaches the retry manager. This ordering prevents a later attempt from overlapping stale cleanup.
- Cleanup that can outlive a request attempt must be conditional on the worker that acquired the booking. `RequestGuard` uses `free_if_worker` (ownership mismatch = no-op). The admission lifecycle lease ends before handoff and remains request-ID-only.
- `SchedulerQueueActor::admit_one` is the required admission path: compute projected
  load, select a worker, skip the capacity reservation if the response receiver
  is closed, then reserve capacity before responding. Failed response delivery
  must release that capacity. Do not bypass this for normal scheduling.
- Do not remove or weaken `admission_gate` without proving selection and
  capacity reservation cannot assign more work than the workers can hold.
- Potential-load projection must go through
  `ActiveSequencesMultiWorker::potential_blocks_and_tokens_at(...)` with
  `SchedulingRequest::prefill_token_deltas()`. Do not scan per-worker
  `ActiveSequences` directly from scheduling.
- `SchedulingRequest` helper methods are the single source for effective
  cached tokens, effective overlap, worker allowance, prefill-token defaults,
  and request block count. Do not duplicate this logic in policies or selectors.
- Weighted shortest processing time (WSPT) must use cache-aware prefill cost: pinned requests use the pinned worker's
  effective cached tokens; unpinned requests use the best allowed worker. Do not
  silently fall back to raw input sequence length (ISL) unless tracking is disabled or cache data is
  absent.
- Pinned-worker and allowed-worker constraints must be validated before
  selection and respected by queue capacity checks, selector candidate
  iteration, and WSPT priority.
- Prefill load hints are computed at scheduler/request boundaries from
  selected-worker `cached_tokens`. Do not move ISL/cache-token math back into
  `ActiveSequences`.
- Selectors should be side-effect free: no capacity reservation, no queue mutation, and no
  `PromptRegistry` mutation.
- Do not hold the pending-heap lock while selecting, reading worker capacity,
  responding, or awaiting. The queue heap is only for waiting requests.
- Do not hold `workers_with_configs.borrow()` across `.await`; take a short
  synchronous snapshot or borrow for selection only.
- Any change to queue ordering, WSPT keys, capacity checks, admission
  serialization, or selector scoring should include focused tests and
  before/after routing or queue benchmarks.
- Keep text and external IDs such as request IDs on standard hash collections.
  Use `FxHashMap` / `FxHashSet` for internal numeric hot-path keys only.

## Public Worker-Selection API

The `selector` module contains the public Rust contract for custom worker scorers and pickers. Treat each public item as a versioned external API.

- Do not add a public field, accessor, input group, type, or re-export unless the task explicitly requires a new external policy capability.
- An internal need in the default scorer, logging, tests, or SelectionService does not justify a public API addition.
- Trace a proposed value to its source before you expose it. Record whether it is raw state, a derived estimate, or an intermediate in Dynamo's default formula.
- Expose raw facts or complete user-facing abstractions. Do not expose partial credit, weighted overlap, legacy arithmetic, or another intermediate whose meaning depends on the default policy.
- Keep struct fields private. Add the narrowest accessor that supports the approved use case.
- Return `Option` for absent data. Do not replace absence with a sentinel value.
- Document the source, units, lifetime, staleness, missing-data behavior, weighting, and clamping for each public value.
- Require callers to name each `WorkerInputs` group that they use. Do not add a public `ALL` shortcut.
- Before you add a value to an existing input group, account for its calculation and retained-column cost for every policy that requests that group.
- Do not expose `SchedulingRequest`, worker maps, router configuration internals, default-score weights, or host-owned eligibility and reservation state.
- Keep `DefaultWorkerScorer` and `DefaultWorkerPicker` internal. External policies own both stages of their policy.
- Keep eligibility, picker-row validation, accounting, and reservation in the host path.

Before each public API addition:

1. Search all accessors, re-exports, documentation, examples, and external-looking call sites.
2. Add one focused contract test that uses the new value through `WorkerScorer` or `WorkerPicker`.
3. Update `docs/fern/pages/developer-guide/advanced-customizations/custom-worker-selection.mdx` and one canonical example.
4. If the signal adds work, storage, allocation, or another scan to the selection path, run the worker-selection benchmark.
