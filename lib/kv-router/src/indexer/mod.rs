//! KV RadixTree
//!
//! This module implements a key-value (KV) store using a Radix Tree structure to efficiently manage and retrieve data blocks.
//! It is designed to support LLM (Large Language Model) inference by re-using a global KV cache.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The main components of this module include:
//!
//! - **Radix Tree Structure**:
//!   - The `RadixTree` struct represents the main data structure, with nodes (`RadixBlock`) containing children and associated worker IDs.
//!   - It allows efficient storage and retrieval of data blocks based on their hashes.
//!
//! - **Event Handling**:
//!   - The `RouterEvent` struct represents events emitted by LLM workers, which can be applied to the Radix Tree to update its state.
//!   - The `KvIndexer` struct manages these events and match requests asynchronously using Tokio channels.
//!
//! - **Hash Computation**:
//!   - Functions like `compute_block_hash` and `compute_block_hash_for_seq` compute hashes for data blocks and sequences of tokens, facilitating quick lookups.
//!
//! - **Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations**:
//!   - The `KvIndexer` uses a single-threaded Tokio runtime to handle events and match requests concurrently, ensuring efficient processing without blocking.
//!
//! - **Match Requests**:
//!   - The `MatchRequest` struct represents requests to find matches in the Radix Tree, returning overlap scores indicating the best matches.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! This module provides a scalable and efficient way to manage and retrieve data blocks for LLM inference, leveraging a global KV cache to optimize performance.
