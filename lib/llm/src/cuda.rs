//! Module to integration with CUDA
//!
//! This module will be a standalong crates, likely called `dynamo-cuda`; however, for the time, it will
//! life as a submodule of `dynamo-llm`.
//!
//! This implementation will include a set of traits for extracting raw `cudarc::driver::sys` objects.
//!
//! Dynamo will generally not be the primary compute driver within an application, but a secondary source
//! of logic that may be used inconjunction with the primary compute driver, e.g. vLLM use of PyTorch is
//! the primary CUDA context.
//!
//! In order for Dynamo to avoid creating its own CUDA context, the following traits are provided so
//! that we may tap the lower level CUDA context, streams, events, etcs from external sources and leverage
//! them within Dynamo.
