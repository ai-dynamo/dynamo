//! The `disconnect` module provides a mechanism for our axum http services to monitoring and responding
//! to disconnects from the client.
//!
//! There are two potential phases in any request where we need to handle the disconnect.
//!
//! For unary, request-response, there is just a single phase where the primary task that axum kicks off
//! to handle the request will be dropped if the client disconnects. In order for us to have a long running
//! task, like an LLM request, we need to spawn our long running task in a separate task and then spawn
//! a second task that will monitor for disconnects from the client. The primary task which spawned the
//! two tasks will hold an "armed" [`ConnectionHandle`] which will issue a [`ConnectionStatus::ClosedUnexpectedly`]
//! if the task is dropped before it is [`ConnectionHandle::disarm`]ed.
//!
//! For the streaming case, request in - stream out, we need a second [`ConnectionHandle`] which will be owned
//! by the stream. A streaming response is when the [`axum::response::Response]] is a [axum::response::Sse] stream.
//! This means the primary task handle will go out of scope when it returns the stream. When we create our
//! SSE stream, we capture the second [`ConnectionHandle`] and arm it. If the stream closes gracefully, the
//! second handle will be disarmed, otherwise, the stream was dropped and the [`Drop`] trait on the [`ConnectionHandle`]
//! triggers a [`ConnectionStatus::ClosedUnexpectedly`] signal.
//!
//! The [`ConnectionHandle`] is a simple wrapper around a [`tokio::sync::oneshot::Sender`] which will send a
//! [`ConnectionStatus`] enum to the primary task. The primary task will then use this to determine if it should
//! cancel the request or not.
//!
