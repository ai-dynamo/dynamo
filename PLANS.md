# KVBM TensorRT-LLM Integration Execution Plan

Last updated: 2026-03-28 UTC

## Objective

Implement the KVBM-backed TensorRT-LLM KV manager path described in
`docs/design-docs/kvbm-trtllm-integration.md`, keep this file as the compact
working log, and iterate until the supported path is complete or blocked by an
external dependency that cannot be resolved from this machine.

## Constraints And Environment Findings

- Local repo instructions were read from `Agents.md`.
- The design source of truth is
  `docs/design-docs/kvbm-trtllm-integration.md`.
- Local TensorRT-LLM checkout exists at `/tmp/trtllm-latest`.
- Pinned upstream TensorRT-LLM commit for this work:
  `3318aca3f4cabf71a323c6e2868f6586817d03cb`.
- Current shell environment has `python3`, `cargo`, and `uv`.
- Current shell environment does not have importable `torch`,
  `tensorrt_llm`, or `pytest` on the default interpreter path.
- Tests therefore need to prefer:
  - Rust unit tests runnable with `cargo test`
  - Python stdlib tests with stubbed modules
  - compile/import checks that do not require the full TRT-LLM runtime

## Phase 0 Decisions

Status: completed

- Supported upstream seam is the PyTorch v2-shaped manager surface in
  `tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/resource_manager.py`.
- Initial support matrix is intentionally narrow:
  - TensorRT-LLM pinned to `3318aca3f4cabf71a323c6e2868f6586817d03cb`
  - single GPU
  - beam width 1
  - aggregated execution only
  - no pipeline parallelism
  - no tensor parallelism
  - no speculative decoding in the first runnable path
- Initial attention/backend target is the TRTLLM attention path that consumes:
  - `copy_batch_block_offsets`
  - `get_block_ids_per_seq`
  - `get_buffers`
  - `get_unique_primary_pool`
- Initial exported KV tensor layout target is `NHD`.
- `kv_cache_manager.impl` consumers have to be handled explicitly; they are not
  an optional follow-up.

## Supported-Path Inventory

Status: completed

Primary v2-shaped surface found in local TRT-LLM checkout:

- `prepare_context`
- `resize_context`
- `try_allocate_generation`
- `is_request_active`
- `suspend_request`
- `prepare_resources`
- `update_resources`
- `free_resources`
- `copy_batch_block_offsets`
- `get_cache_indices`
- `get_batch_cache_indices`
- `get_block_ids_per_seq`
- `get_buffers`
- `get_num_free_blocks`
- `get_num_available_tokens`
- `get_num_kv_blocks`
- `add_dummy_requests`
- `get_kv_cache_stats`

Observed `impl` and compatibility touch points:

- `/tmp/trtllm-latest/tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/_util.py`
- `/tmp/trtllm-latest/tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/kv_cache_transceiver.py`
- `/tmp/trtllm-latest/tensorrt_llm/_torch/disaggregation/resource/kv_extractor.py`
- `/tmp/trtllm-latest/tensorrt_llm/_torch/auto_deploy/shim/ad_executor.py`
- `/tmp/trtllm-latest/tensorrt_llm/_torch/pyexecutor/py_executor.py`

Observed existing repo state:

- `kvbm.trtllm_integration` currently exposes connector classes only.
- `kvbm.trtllm_integration.rust` still imports `_vllm_integration`.
- No dedicated TensorRT-LLM KV cache manager module exists yet.
- Existing Rust DLPack export code is block-oriented in:
  - `lib/bindings/kvbm/src/block_manager/block.rs`
  - `lib/bindings/kvbm/src/block_manager/layer.rs`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Dedicated TRTLLM integration module

Status: completed

Goal:

- Stop reusing `_vllm_integration` as the public TensorRT-LLM module name.
- Add a dedicated Python manager entry point and dedicated Rust module surface.

Planned changes:

- Add `kvbm.trtllm_integration.kv_cache_manager`.
- Add a dedicated `_trtllm_integration` Rust pymodule that re-exports the
  shared request/block primitives plus TRTLLM-specific connector classes.
- Update the Python Rust loader to import `_trtllm_integration`.
- Add unit tests that validate the loader and manager surface using stubbed
  TensorRT-LLM modules.

### Phase 2: Manager shell and request-state contract

Status: in progress

Goal:

- Land a thin Python `KvbmKVCacheManager` with the v2-shaped contract.
- Back it with minimal internal state and explicit `NotImplementedError`
  boundaries where KVBM-owned tensor export is not wired yet.

Implemented so far:

- Constructor/attribute validation
- request lifecycle bookkeeping
- cache-index export helpers
- dummy-request seeding
- explicit `NotImplementedError` boundaries for tensor export

Still pending in this phase:

- tensor-shaped host block-offset bookkeeping backed by the real export path
- integration with a real Rust-backed allocator/export path
- draft-path semantics beyond basic bookkeeping
- optional environment bootstrapping for richer TRTLLM/PyTorch validation later
### Phase 3: Buffer and primary-pool export

Status: pending

Goal:

- Replace placeholder tensor ownership with KVBM-backed exported views.

Planned changes:

- Add non-block-oriented Rust tensor export helpers
- export primary pool tensor
- export per-layer tensors compatible with TRTLLM expectations

### Phase 4: Full request lifecycle ownership

Status: pending

Goal:

- Move context/generation growth, teardown, and reuse fully under the KVBM
  manager for the supported path.

### Phase 5: `impl` compatibility surface

Status: pending

Goal:

- Implement or patch the minimal `impl` surface still needed by the pinned
  supported path.

## Progress Log

- Completed design inventory against local TRT-LLM checkout.
- Confirmed the current repo has TRT-LLM connector integration but not a KV
  manager integration.
- Confirmed the first practical coding milestone is a dedicated TRTLLM module
  boundary plus a manager shell and tests that can run without the full runtime.
- Added a dedicated Rust `_trtllm_integration` pymodule in
  `lib/bindings/kvbm/src/block_manager/trtllm.rs`.
- Updated the Python TRTLLM Rust loader to import `_trtllm_integration` instead
  of `_vllm_integration`.
- Added `kvbm.trtllm_integration.kv_cache_manager.KvbmKVCacheManager` as a thin
  dependency-light manager shell.
- Added stdlib-only tests in `lib/bindings/kvbm/tests/test_trtllm_integration.py`.
- Added host slot and block-offset bookkeeping to the manager shell so
  `copy_batch_block_offsets()` now mirrors TRTLLM-style cached block rows
  instead of directly returning raw block IDs.
- Inspected KVBM storage/layout internals and found the key phase-3 tension:
  `FullyContiguous` can provide a clean primary-pool slab, but the current
  DLPack helper only exports contiguous shapes, while TRTLLM also needs
  per-layer views that are not naturally contiguous in that layout.

## New Findings

- Current DLPack export in `lib/bindings/kvbm/src/block_manager/dlpack.rs`
  assumes contiguous tensors only.
- `FullyContiguous` layout is a good fit for `get_unique_primary_pool()`.
- The same layout is a poor fit for `get_buffers(layer_idx)` unless one of the
  following happens:
  - add stride-aware DLPack export
  - switch the exported pool layout strategy
  - maintain a second tensor-oriented export representation
- This means phase 3 is not just plumbing; it requires an explicit export-model
  decision before coding the real buffer path.

## Testing Log

- Passed: `python3 -m unittest discover -s lib/bindings/kvbm/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
- Passed: `cargo test --manifest-path lib/bindings/kvbm/Cargo.toml --no-run`
- Passed again after host block-offset changes:
  `python3 -m unittest discover -s lib/bindings/kvbm/tests -p 'test_*.py'`
- Failed once due to wrong package selector:
  `cargo test -p kvbm --manifest-path lib/bindings/kvbm/Cargo.toml --no-run`
  Reason: the crate is named `kvbm-py3`, not `kvbm`.

## Remaining Work

- Finish Phase 2 by tightening the manager contract around real TRTLLM request
  semantics and host block-offset handling.
- Resolve the phase-3 export-model decision and then wire KVBM-backed
  primary-pool and per-layer tensor export.
- Add tests that validate exported shapes and indices without requiring the full
  TRT-LLM runtime.
- Continue updating this file after every milestone with exact next steps.

## Exact Next Step

1. Decide the phase-3 export model:
   stride-aware DLPack versus alternate layout versus dual representation.
2. If no TRTLLM/PyTorch runtime is available locally, treat that validation gap
   as an external blocker and avoid landing an unverified buffer ABI.
3. Once the export model is chosen, add focused Rust export objects and tests
   before wiring them into `KvbmKVCacheManager`.
