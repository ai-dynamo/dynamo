[TEST] 2025-07-08T00:54:29 INFO test_serve_deployment[trtllm_agg]: Received Content: Okay, so I need to come up with a short joke about AI. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I know that AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is about machines being able to think and learn like humans. Maybe I can play on words related to that.

Let me think about common AI jokes I've heard before. There's the classic one where someone asks an AI, "What do you think about climate change?" and the AI responds, "I think it's getting worse, but I'm not sure. I could look it up, but I don't have access to the internet." That's funny because it highlights the limitations of AI.

But I need a different angle. Maybe something about how AI is always learning

I remember hearing some jokes about robots or AI having no sense of humor, but I want something more original. Let me think about common puns or wordplay involving AI. Maybe something about their reactions or how they process information.

Wait, what about the difference between AI and a parrot? A parrot repeats what it hears, while AI processes data. That could be a setup. Then, the punchline would be something like, "What do you call an AI that doesn
