# Example: How to add workflow-level error classification to your workflows
#
# Add this job at the END of your workflow file (after all other jobs)
# It will run after everything completes and classify all failures

jobs:
  # ... your existing jobs (operator, vllm, sglang, trtllm, etc.) ...

  # Add this at the end:
  classify-workflow-errors:
    name: Classify Workflow Errors
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Always run, even if other jobs failed or were cancelled
    if: always() && !cancelled()
    # List ALL jobs that this should wait for
    needs: [operator, vllm, sglang, trtllm, deploy-operator, deploy-test-vllm, deploy-test-sglang, deploy-test-trtllm, cleanup]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Classify All Workflow Errors
        env:

          # Run workflow-level classification
          python3 .github/workflows/classify_workflow_errors.py || echo "⚠️  Classification failed but continuing"

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# ================
# 1. Update the 'needs' list to include ALL jobs in your workflow
# 2. This job will ALWAYS run (even if other jobs fail) due to if: always()
# 3. Per-job classification (if: failure() steps) can be REMOVED since this handles everything
# 4. The script fetches logs for ALL failed jobs and creates comprehensive annotations
# 5. Results are uploaded to OpenSearch if configured

# BENEFITS:
# =========
# ✅ Works reliably - fetches logs from completed jobs (no 404 errors)
# ✅ Complete view - sees all failures across all jobs in one place
# ✅ Better context - can correlate related failures
# ✅ Single annotation set - cleaner PR experience
# ✅ Cost efficient - classifies once at the end vs. per-job
