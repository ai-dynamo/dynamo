# Version Pinning Strategy:
# - Use == for packages that are pure Python and well-tested
# - Use <= or < for packages that may have platform-specific versions
# - Never use >= as it allows untested future versions that may introduce breaking changes,
#   create non-reproducible builds, and cause dependency conflicts. Every installed version
#   should be explicitly tested, not an unknown future release.

# Dependencies used exclusively by the planner and profiler components.
# These are installed only in the dynamo-planner image (--target=planner).
