# Async Speculative Decoding

This guide demonstrates how to run Draft-Target Model (DTM) speculative decoding asynchronously in Dynamo, where the draft model and target model run as separate Dynamo workers with the TRT-LLM backend.

## Setup

Follow the [Quickstart setup](./README.md#quick-start) instructions. Then, inside the container, run the following example:

```
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/components/backends/trtllm
./launch/spec_dec.sh
```

To scale up the number of drafters:

```
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/components/backends/trtllm
export NUM_DRAFTERS=2
export DRAFTER_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES:-"1,2"
./launch/spec_dec.sh
```

## Parallel Speculative Decoding

To enable parallel speculative decoding, add the ```--parallel-spec-dec``` to the verifier:

```
# run verifier worker with speculative decoding
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$VERIFIER_CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES \
python3 -m dynamo.trtllm \
  --model-path "$MODEL_PATH" \
  --served-model-name "$SERVED_MODEL_NAME" \
  --extra-engine-args "$VERIFIER_ENGINE_ARGS" \
  --spec-dec-mode "verifier" & \
  --parallel-spec-dec
VERIFIER_PID=$!
```
